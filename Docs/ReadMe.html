Rendering Engine)</p>

<p class="mainheader" align="left">Summary</p>




<p>OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a
scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it
easier and more intuitive for developers to produce games and demos
utilising 3D hardware. The class library abstracts all the details of
using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and
provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive
classes. 
</p>




<p>This distribution contains the full original source code for OGRE
and is the most flexible way of obtaining the engine, although it
does require you to build it yourself. For people who want a little
more convenience, at the expense of a larger download and slightly
less flexibility, there is also a precompiled SDK release available
for some compilers.</p>
