<p class="mainheader" align="left">License Summary</p>

<p>OGRE is primarily released under an <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source</a> license. You have two licensing options when using OGRE:</p>
<ul><li>Ogre&#8217;s default  license is the <a href="#LGPL">GNU  Lesser Public License (LGPL) with some specific exceptions</a>. This license is free as in beer and as in speech.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can license OGRE under a non-open source license called the <a href="#OUL">OGRE 'Unrestricted' License (OUL)</a>, for a fee.</li>
</ul>
	
<a name="LGPL"></a><p class="mainheader" align="left">LGPL (with exceptions)</p>
			
				
<p>Under  the <a href="licenses/lgpl.txt">LGPL</a> you may use Ogre for any purpose you wish, and modify it if you require, as long as you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pass on the (potentially modified) Ogre source code with your software, with original copyrights intact
<ol>
<li>If you distribute electronically, the source can be a separate download (either from your own site if you modified Ogre, or to www.ogre3d.org if you used an unmodified version) - just include a link in your documentation</li>
<li>If you distribute physical media, the Ogre source that you used to build your application should be included on that media, whether you modified it or not</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>Make it clear where you have customised it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The  above is a precis, please do read the <a href="licenses/lgpl.txt">full license text</a>. However, in order to make the use of OGRE simpler, we make exceptions / clarifications to the standard LGPL as described below.
<p><b><u>Exceptions To The LGPL For OGRE</u></b></p>
<p>The following exceptions / clarifications shall apply to the LGPL license in the case of the OGRE source code:
<ol><li>Making modifications to OGRE configuration files, build scripts and configuration headers such as OgreConfig.h in order to create a customised build setup of OGRE with the otherwise unmodified source code, does not constitute a derived work</li>
	<li>Building against OGRE headers which have inlined code does not constitute a derived work</li>
	<li>User code which subclasses OGRE classes does not form a derivative work</li>
	<li>Statically linking the OGRE libraries into a user application does not make the user application a derived work, and therefore does not require the user to pass on the source code or object code to their own application. The OGRE source code with all modifications must still be passed on in the same way as using OGRE as a shared library. </li>
	<li>Using source code obsfucation on the OGRE source code when distributing it is not permitted .</li>
	</ol>
	</p>


<a name="OUL"></a><p class="mainheader" align="left">OGRE 'Unrestricted' License (OUL)</p>
<p>For whatever reason some users feel that they cannot comply with, or would prefer not to comply with the conditions of the LGPL described above. Reasons might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>You wish to alter the OGRE core without releasing those changes publicly</li>
<li>Despite the quite lenient conditions of the LGPL, you are constrained by licensing policies that prevent you using an open source license</li>
</ul>
<p>To allow users with these issues to still consider using OGRE, an alternative license, the OGRE &#8220;Unrestricted&#8221; License (OUL), is available for a license fee. Thus users who have a specific need to avoid the conditions of the LGPL for their projects have the option of paying for a different license.<p><strong>If you are interested in obtaining this alternative license, please <a href="http://www.torusknot.com/contact.php">contact Torus Knot Software</a> for more details.</strong></p></blockquote>
