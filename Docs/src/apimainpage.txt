  @subsection s1 What is this?
  This is the complete API reference for <a href="www.ogre3d.org"><b>OGRE</b></a> (<b>O</b>bject-Oriented <b>G</b>raphics <b>R</b>endering <b>E</b>ngine) version <b>1.9.0</b> ("Ghadamon"). Contained within are the 
  specifications for each namespace/module/class and the methods from those which you can refer to when writing code which uses OGRE. 
  
  The API references for some of the previous OGRE versions can be found under the following link: <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/api/X.Y">www.ogre3d.org/docs/api/X.Y</a> (replace X.Y with the version number, for example 1.7 or 1.8).
  
  @subsection s2 It's so BIG!
  
  Yes it is (and thank you for noticing). OGRE is a large and complex 
  system so the API documentation, whilst fully inclusive and the most 
  complete reference to OGRE that you'll find, is not the recommended way to 
  start learning. You will certainly want
  to refer to this documentation once you have found your feet, and pretty soon
  referring to it will become second nature. Until then, you should begin with 
  more "discussive" documentation such as:
  @li <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/manual/"><b>The Manual</b></a>: The OGRE manual is a
	general introduction to the OGRE principles and core components, and a 
	reference to various important parts of the OGRE system, especially the
	script syntax for materials, particle systems, and overlays. You should 
    find a local copy of this in your distribution.  
  @li <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki"><b>The OGRE Wiki</b></a>: A Wiki is a 
  	collaborative web-based documentation system where people in the whole 
	OGRE community can contribute tips, tutorials and sample code, among other 
	things. This is a gold mine for new and experienced users alike.

  We make an effort to document our classes fully so we hope you can find what
  you need here. However, if you can't find it, or you're not sure where to 
  start looking, visit the <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org">main OGRE website</a> and dip into the <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/support">community areas</a>
  like the <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki">wiki</a> and the <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/">forums</a> to get some assistance.
