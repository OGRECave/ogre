## Summary
<b>OGRE</b> (<b>O</b>bject-Oriented <b>G</b>raphics <b>R</b>endering <b>E</b>ngine) is a
scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it
easier and more intuitive for developers to produce games and demos
utilising 3D hardware. The class library abstracts all the details of
using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and
provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive
classes.

### Attention: this is a Fork

This is not a pure mirror of the [OGRE Project at Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/sinbad/ogre/) but a fork with a diverged codebase. If you wonder what is different, see [git-ChangeLog](git-ChangeLog.md).

The current CI status is: Ubuntu/ OSX/ Android/ iOS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OGRECave/ogre.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OGRECave/ogre)
MSVC [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/kcki7y0n1ahrggdw/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/paroj/ogre-bsrh7/branch/master)
