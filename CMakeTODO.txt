TODO
====

Essential before switch-on as primary system

* Establish 3rd-party library build procedure
  * For projects using CMake: Need to enhance/finish the FindOGRE and OGREConfig scripts
  * For projects not using CMake: Probably little changes, but examples would still be good
* Test Code::Blocks / MinGW


To be done after switch-over

* SDK changes - Win32 and OS X scripts will need altering
* Pregenerating project files for source packages (& SDK's) - absolute paths will break this, can we use relative dirs?
* GLES project
* OS X
  * Ogre framework is building, plugins and samples still need looking at
* CPack
  * Investigate .deb, .rpm packages for Linux

OGRE CHANGES ONCE LIVE
======================

- Docs/src/html.cfg is no longer necessary as it is generated from CMakeTemplates/html.cfg.in
- New dependencies packages needed:
  - Remove Dependencies/CMakeLists.txt from OGRE source tree. This file should be provided by
    the pre-built dependencies package 
  - Place DLLs in Dependencies/bin instead of Samples/Common/bin, since the latter is no longer in use
