TODO
====

* Establish 3rd-party library build procedure
  * For projects using CMake: Need to enhance/finish the FindOGRE and OGREConfig scripts
  * For projects not using CMake: Probably little changes, but examples would still be good
* Delete native Code::Blocks / MinGW


To be done after switch-over

* SDK changes - Win32 and OS X scripts will need altering
* GLES project - This needs some testing, could be complete
* OS X
  * Only Debug and Release builds are supported at the moment, since the others still use the same folders. 
* CPack
  * Investigate .deb, .rpm packages for Linux

* New dependencies packages needed:
  * Remove Dependencies/CMakeLists.txt from OGRE source tree. This file should be provided by
    the pre-built dependencies package 
  * Place DLLs in Dependencies/bin instead of Samples/Common/bin, since the latter is no longer in use
  * Dependencies should be installed in the build directory, not the ogre directory, so that multiple compilers may be supported from one source folder
