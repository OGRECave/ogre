/** Caching, on-the-fly material generator. This is a class that automatically 
	generates and stores different permutations of a material, and its shaders. 
	It can be used if you have a material that has lots of slightly different 
	variations, like whether to use a specular light, skinning, normal mapping 
	and other options. Writing all these out is a tedious job. Of course it is 
	possible to always use the material with all features, but that might result 
	in large, slow shader programs. This class provides an efficient solution
	to that.
