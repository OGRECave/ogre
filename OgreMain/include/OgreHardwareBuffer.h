    /** Abstract class defining common features of hardware buffers.

        A 'hardware buffer' is any area of memory held outside of core system ram,
        and in our case refers mostly to video ram, although in theory this class
        could be used with other memory areas such as sound card memory, custom
        coprocessor memory etc.
    @par
        This reflects the fact that memory held outside of main system RAM must 
        be interacted with in a more formal fashion in order to promote
        cooperative and optimal usage of the buffers between the various 
        processing units which manipulate them.
    @par
        This abstract class defines the core interface which is common to all
        buffers, whether it be vertex buffers, index buffers, texture memory
        or framebuffer memory etc.
    @par
        Buffers have the ability to be 'shadowed' in system memory, this is because
        the kinds of access allowed on hardware buffers is not always as flexible as
        that allowed for areas of system memory - for example it is often either 
        impossible, or extremely undesirable from a performance standpoint to read from
        a hardware buffer; when writing to hardware buffers, you should also write every
        byte and do it sequentially. In situations where this is too restrictive, 
        it is possible to create a hardware, write-only buffer (the most efficient kind) 
        and to back it with a system memory 'shadow' copy which can be read and updated arbitrarily.
        Ogre handles synchronising this buffer with the real hardware buffer (which should still be
        created with the HBU_DYNAMIC flag if you intend to update it very frequently). Whilst this
        approach does have its own costs, such as increased memory overhead, these costs can 
        often be outweighed by the performance benefits of using a more hardware efficient buffer.
        You should look for the 'useShadowBuffer' parameter on the creation methods used to create
        the buffer of the type you require (see HardwareBufferManager) to enable this feature.

                 all. If you’re not using a shadow buffer, it requires the buffer to be transferred
                 from the card and back again. If you’re using a shadow buffer the effect is

                that the card can avoid any stalls if the buffer is currently being rendered from,
                because it will actually give you an entirely different one. Use this wherever
                possible when you are locking a buffer which was not created with a shadow buffer.
                If you are using a shadow buffer it matters less, although with a shadow buffer it’s
                preferable to lock the entire buffer at once, because that allows the shadow buffer
                to use HBL_DISCARD when it uploads the updated contents to the real buffer.
