    /** Class defining a single pass of a Technique (of a Material): a single rendering call.

        If a pass does not explicitly use a vertex or fragment shader, %Ogre will calculate
        lighting based on the [Direct3D Light Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d9/mathematics-of-lighting) as:

        If at least one shader is used, the pass is considered *programmable* and the lighting is
        up to the shader.

        Rendering can be repeated with many passes for more complex effects.

        where \f$C = (1, 1, 1)\f$ or a tracked vertex attribute if #TVC_DIFFUSE is set.

        \f[ passBase = G_a \cdot C_a + \sum^N_i ( C_d \cdot L^{(i)}_d +  C_s \cdot L^{(i)}_s ) + C_e \f]

        where
        - \f$G_a\f$ is the ambient colour defined by the SceneManager
        - \f$C_a\f$ is the pass ambient colour
        - \f$C_e\f$ is the pass self-illumination colour or a tracked vertex attribute
        - \f$N\f$ is the number of lights considered during light iteration
        - \f$C_d\f$ is the pass diffuse colour or a tracked vertex attribute
        - \f$C_s\f$ is the pass specular colour or a tracked vertex attribute
        - \f$L_d^{(i)}\f$ is the (attenuated) diffuse colour of the i-th Light
        - \f$L_s^{(i)}\f$ is the (attenuated) specular colour of the i-th Light

        @par Programmable passes

        Programmable passes are complex to define, because they require custom
        programs and you have to set all constant inputs to the programs (like
        the position of lights, any base material colours you wish to use etc), but
        they do give you much total flexibility over the algorithms used to render your
        pass, and you can create some effects which are impossible with a fixed-function pass.
        On the other hand, you can define a fixed-function pass in very little time, and
        you can use a range of fixed-function effects like environment mapping very
        easily, plus your pass will be more likely to be compatible with older hardware.
        There are pros and cons to both, just remember that if you use a programmable
        pass to create some great effects, allow more time for definition and testing.

            The hashcode of a Pass is used to sort Passes for rendering, in order
            to reduce the number of render state changes. Each Pass represents a
            single unique set of states, but by ordering them, state changes can
            be minimised between passes. An implementation of this functor should
            order passes so that the elements that you want to keep constant are
            sorted next to each other.

            When polygons are coplanar, you can get problems with 'depth fighting' where

            a problem for decals (polys attached to another surface to represent details such as
            bulletholes etc.).

            A way to combat this problem is to use a depth bias to adjust the depth buffer value
            used for the decal such that it is slightly higher than the true value, ensuring that
            the decal appears on top. There are two aspects to the biasing, a constant
            bias value and a slope-relative biasing value, which varies according to the
            maximum depth slope relative to the camera, ie:

            $$finalBias = maxSlope * slopeScaleBias + constantBias$$

            Slope scale biasing is relative to the angle of the polygon to the camera, which makes
            for a more appropriate bias value, but this is ignored on some older hardware. Constant
            biasing is expressed as a factor of the minimum depth value, so a value of 1 will nudge
            the depth by one ’notch’ if you will.

            SceneManager's that use it (since it is best used on large groups of planar world geometry rather

            In this case the culling is based on whether the ’back’ or ’front’ of the triangle is facing the
            camera - this definition is based on the face normal (a vector which sticks out of the front side of
            the polygon perpendicular to the face). Since %Ogre expects face normals to be on anticlockwise side
            of the face, Ogre::MANUAL_CULL_BACK is the software equivalent of Ogre::CULL_CLOCKWISE setting,
            which is why they are both the default. The naming is different to reflect the way the culling is
            done though, since most of the time face normals are pre-calculated and they don’t have to be the
            way %Ogre expects - you could set Ogre::CULL_NONE and completely cull in software based on your

            The default behaviour for a pass (when this option is 'false'), is
            for a pass to be rendered only once (or the number of times set in
            setPassIterationCount), with all the lights which could
            affect this object set at the same time (up to the maximum lights
            allowed in the render system, which is typically 8).
            @par
            Setting this option to 'true' changes this behaviour, such that
            instead of trying to issue render this pass once per object, it
            is run <b>per light</b>, or for a group of 'n' lights each time
            which can affect this object, the number of
            times set in setPassIterationCount (default is once). In
            this case, only light index 0 is ever used, and is a different light
            every time the pass is issued, up to the total number of lights
            which is affecting this object. This has 2 advantages:
            <ul><li>There is no limit on the number of lights which can be
            supported</li>
            <li>It's easier to write vertex / fragment programs for this because
            a single program can be used for any number of lights</li>
            </ul>
            However, this technique is more expensive, and typically you
            will want an additional ambient pass, because if no lights are
            affecting the object it will not be rendered at all, which will look
            odd even if ambient light is zero (imagine if there are lit objects
            behind it - the objects silhouette would not show up). Therefore,
            use this option with care, and you would be well advised to provide
            a less expensive fallback technique for use in the distance.
            @note
            The number of times this pass runs is still limited by the maximum
            number of lights allowed as set in setMaxSimultaneousLights, so
            you will never get more passes than this. Also, the iteration is
            started from the 'start light' as set in Pass::setStartLight, and
            the number of passes is the number of lights to iterate over divided
            by the number of lights per iteration (default 1, set by
            setLightCountPerIteration).

            In order to cut down on fillrate when you have a number of fixed-range
            lights in the scene, you can enable this option to request that
            during rendering, only the region of the screen which is covered by
            the lights is rendered. This region is the screen-space rectangle
            covering the union of the spheres making up the light ranges. Directional
            lights are ignored for this.

            This is only likely to be useful for multipass additive lighting
            algorithms, where the scene has already been 'seeded' with an ambient
            pass and this pass is just adding light in affected areas.

            When using Ogre::SHADOWTYPE_STENCIL_ADDITIVE or Ogre::SHADOWTYPE_TEXTURE_ADDITIVE,
            this option is implicitly used for all per-light passes and does
            not need to be specified. If you are not using shadows or are using
            a modulative or @ref Integrated-Texture-Shadows then this could be useful.

        /** Sets whether or not this pass will be clipped by user clips planes

            This option will only function if there is a single non-directional light being used in
            this pass. If there is more than one light, or only directional lights, then no clipping
            will occur. If there are no lights at all then the objects won’t be rendered at all.

            In order to cut down on the geometry set up to render this pass
            when you have a single fixed-range light being rendered through it,
            you can enable this option to request that during triangle setup,
            clip planes are defined to bound the range of the light. In the case
            of a point light these planes form a cube, and in the case of
            a spotlight they form a pyramid. Directional lights are never clipped.

            This option is only likely to be useful for multipass additive lighting
            algorithms, where the scene has already been 'seeded' with an ambient
            pass and this pass is just adding light in affected areas. In addition,
            it will only be honoured if there is exactly one non-directional light
            being used in this pass. Also, these clip planes override any user clip
            planes set on Camera.

            When using Ogre::SHADOWTYPE_STENCIL_ADDITIVE or Ogre::SHADOWTYPE_TEXTURE_ADDITIVE,
            this option is automatically used for all per-light passes if you
            enable Ogre::SceneManager::setShadowUseLightClipPlanes and does
            not need to be specified. It is disabled by default since clip planes have
            a cost of their own which may not always exceed the benefits they give you.
            Generally the smaller your lights are the more chance you’ll see a benefit rather than
            a penalty from clipping.

            @note Only has an effect with the fixed-function pipeline. Exceptions:
            - with D3D9, clip planes are even available when shaders are used
            - with GL1, shaders must write to gl_ClipVertex

        /** Manually set which illumination stage this pass is a member of.

            When using an additive lighting mode (Ogre::SHADOWTYPE_STENCIL_ADDITIVE or
            Ogre::SHADOWTYPE_TEXTURE_ADDITIVE), the scene is rendered in 3 discrete
            stages, ambient (or pre-lighting), per-light (once per light, with
            shadowing) and decal (or post-lighting). Usually OGRE figures out how
            to categorise your passes automatically, but there are some effects you
            cannot achieve without manually controlling the illumination. For example
            specular effects are muted by the typical sequence because all textures
            are saved until the Ogre::IS_DECAL stage which mutes the specular effect.
            Instead, you could do texturing within the per-light stage if it's
            possible for your material and thus add the specular on after the
            decal texturing, and have no post-light rendering.

            If you assign an illumination stage to a pass you have to assign it
            to all passes in the technique otherwise it will be ignored. Also note
            that whilst you can have more than one pass in each group, they cannot
            alternate, ie all ambient passes will be before all per-light passes,
            which will also be before all decal passes. Within their categories
            the passes will retain their ordering though.
