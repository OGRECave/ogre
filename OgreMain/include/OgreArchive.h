    /** Archive-handling class.

        An archive is a generic term for a container of files. This may be a
        filesystem folder, it may be a compressed archive, it may even be 
        a remote location shared on the web. This class is designed to be 
        subclassed to provide access to a range of file locations. 
    @par
        Instances of this class are never constructed or even handled by end-user
        applications. They are constructed by custom ArchiveFactory classes, 
        which plugins can register new instances of using ArchiveManager. 
        End-user applications will typically use ResourceManager or 
        ResourceGroupManager to manage resources at a higher level, rather than 
        reading files directly through this class. Doing it this way allows you
        to benefit from OGRE's automatic searching of multiple file locations 
        for the resources you are looking for.
