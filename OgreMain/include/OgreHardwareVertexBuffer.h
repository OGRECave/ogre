            This is useful if you've modified a declaration and want to remove

            declaration is already being used with a VertexBufferBinding, you will
            need to alter that too. This method is mainly useful when reorganising
            buffers based on an altered declaration.

            Whilst in theory you have completely full reign over the format of you vertices, in reality
            there are some restrictions. D3D7 grade hardware imposes a fixed ordering on the elements which are
            pulled from each buffer:

            -   VertexElements should be added in the following order, and the order of the elements within any shared
            buffer should be as follows:
                1.  Positions
                2.  Blending weights
                3.  Normals
                4.  Diffuse colours
                5.  Specular colours
                6.  Texture coordinates (starting at 0, listed in order, with no gaps)
            -   You must not have unused gaps in your buffers which are not referenced by any VertexElement
            -   You must not cause the buffer & offset settings of 2 VertexElements to overlap

            OpenGL and D3D9 compatible hardware are not required to follow these strict limitations, so you might
            find, for example that if you broke these rules your application would run under OpenGL and under DirectX on
            recent cards, but it is not guaranteed to run on older hardware under DirectX unless you stick to the above
            rules.

        with the input data it needs for the vertex elements.

        Why do we have this binding list rather than just have VertexElement referring to the
        vertex buffers direct? Well, in the underlying APIs, binding the vertex buffers to an
        index (or 'stream') is the way that vertex data is linked, so this structure better
        reflects the realities of that. In addition, by separating the vertex declaration from
        the list of vertex buffer bindings, it becomes possible to reuse bindings between declarations
        and vice versa, giving opportunities to reduce the state changes required to perform rendering.
    @par
        Like the other classes in this functional area, these binding maps should be created and
        destroyed using the HardwareBufferManager.
