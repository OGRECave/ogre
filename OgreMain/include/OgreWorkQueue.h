    /** Interface to a general purpose task-basedbackground work queue.

        A work queue is a simple structure, where tasks of work are placed
        onto the queue, then removed by a worker for processing.
        The typical use for this is in a threaded environment,
        although any kind of deferred processing could use this approach to 
        decouple and distribute work over a period of time even 
        if it was single threaded.

        WorkQueues also incorporate thread pools. One or more background worker threads
        can wait on the queue and be notified when a request is waiting to be
        processed. For maximal thread usage, a WorkQueue instance should be shared
        among many sources of work, rather than many work queues being created.
        This way, you can share a small number of hardware threads among a large 
        number of background tasks. This doesn't mean you have to implement all the
        request processing in one class, you can plug in many handlers in order to
        process the tasks.

        This is an abstract interface definition; users can subclass this and 
        provide their own implementation if required to centralise task management
        in their own subsystems. We also provide a default implementation in the
        form of DefaultWorkQueue.
