    /** Class for managing Material settings for %Ogre.

        Materials control the eventual surface rendering properties of geometry. This class
        manages the library of materials, dealing with programmatic registrations and lookups,
        as well as loading predefined Material settings from scripts.

        When loaded from a script, a Material is in an 'unloaded' state and only stores the settings
        required. It does not at that stage load any textures. This is because the material settings may be
        loaded 'en masse' from bulk material script files, but only a subset will actually be required.

        Because this is a subclass of ResourceManager, any files loaded will be searched for in any path or
        archive added to the resource paths/archives. See ResourceManager for details.

        For a definition of the material script format, see @ref Material-Scripts.

        Ogre comes configured with a set of defaults for newly created
        materials. If you wish to have a different set of defaults,
        simply call getDefaultSettings() and change the returned Material's
        settings. All materials created from then on will be configured
        with the new defaults you have specified.

                allows the application to specify a Technique instance manually.

                Material schemes allow you to switch wholesale between families of 
                techniques on a material. However they require you to define those
                schemes on the materials up-front, which might not be possible or
                desirable for all materials, particular if, for example, you wanted
                a simple way to replace all materials with another using a scheme.
            @par
                This callback allows you to handle the case where a scheme is requested
                but the material doesn't have an entry for it. You can return a
                Technique pointer from this method to specify the material technique
                you'd like to be applied instead, which can be from another material
                entirely (and probably will be). Note that it is critical that you
                only return a Technique that is supported on this hardware; there are
                utility methods like Material::getBestTechnique to help you with this.
            @param schemeIndex The index of the scheme that was requested - all 
                schemes have a unique index when created that does not alter. 
            @param schemeName The friendly name of the scheme being requested
            @param originalMaterial The material that is being processed, that 
                didn't have a specific technique for this scheme
            @param lodIndex The material level-of-detail that was being asked for, 
                in case you need to use it to determine a technique.
            @param rend Pointer to the Renderable that is requesting this technique
                to be used, so this may influence your choice of Technique. May be
                null if the technique isn't being requested in that context.
            @return A pointer to the technique to be used, or NULL if you wish to
