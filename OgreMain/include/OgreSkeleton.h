    /** A collection of Bone objects used to animate a skinned mesh.

        Skeletal animation works by having a collection of 'bones' which are 
        actually just joints with a position and orientation, arranged in a tree structure.
        For example, the wrist joint is a child of the elbow joint, which in turn is a
        child of the shoulder joint. Rotating the shoulder automatically moves the elbow
        and wrist as well due to this hierarchy.
    @par
        So how does this animate a mesh? Well every vertex in a mesh is assigned to one or more
        bones which affects it's position when the bone is moved. If a vertex is assigned to 
        more than one bone, then weights must be assigned to determine how much each bone affects
        the vertex (actually a weight of 1.0 is used for single bone assignments). 
        Weighted vertex assignments are especially useful around the joints themselves
        to avoid 'pinching' of the mesh in this region. 
    @par
        Therefore by moving the skeleton using preset animations, we can animate the mesh. The
        advantage of using skeletal animation is that you store less animation data, especially
        as vertex counts increase. In addition, you are able to blend multiple animations together
        (e.g. walking and looking around, running and shooting) and provide smooth transitions
        between animations without incurring as much of an overhead as would be involved if you
        did this on the core vertex data.
    @par
        Skeleton definitions are loaded from datafiles, namely the .skeleton file format. They
        are loaded on demand, especially when referenced by a Mesh.

            changes to bones from their bind positions, it's possible to use the
            same animation data for different skeletons, provided the skeletal
            structure matches and the 'deltas' stored in the keyframes apply
            equally well to the other skeletons bind position (so they must be
            roughly similar, but don't have to be identical). You can use the

            This method takes a skeleton name, rather than a more specific

            of compatibility of skeletal structure, and secondly skeletons are
            the unit of loading. Linking a skeleton to another in this way means
            that the linkee will be prevented from being destroyed until the 
            linker is destroyed.

            You cannot set up cyclic relationships, e.g. SkeletonA uses SkeletonB's
            animations, and SkeletonB uses SkeletonA's animations. This is because
            it would set up a circular dependency which would prevent proper 
            unloading - make one of the skeletons the 'master' in this case.

            skeleton will be loaded immediately if this skeleton is already 
            loaded, otherwise it will be loaded when this skeleton is.
        @param scale A scale factor to apply to translation and scaling elements
            of the keyframes in the other skeleton when applying the animations
            to this one. Compensates for skeleton size differences.
