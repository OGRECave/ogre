            the user of the library is responsible for asking each render
            target to refresh. This is the method used to do this. It automatically
            re-renders the contents of the target using whatever cameras have been
            pointed at it (using Camera::setRenderTarget).
            @par

                constantly as with the automatic rendering loop.

                to true, the target will immediately
                swap it's buffers after update. Otherwise, the buffers are
                not swapped, and you have to call swapBuffers yourself sometime
                later. You might want to do this on some rendersystems which 
                pause for queued rendering commands to complete before accepting
                swap buffers calls - so you could do other CPU tasks whilst the 
                queued commands complete. Or, you might do this if you want custom
                control over your windows, such as for externally created windows.
