    /** An abstraction of a viewport, i.e., a rendering region on a render
        target.

        A viewport is the meeting of a camera and a rendering surface -
        the camera renders the scene from a viewpoint, and places its
        results into some subset of a rendering target, which may be the
        whole surface or just a part of the surface. Each viewport has a
        single camera as source and a single target as destination. A
        camera only has 1 viewport, but a render target may have several.
        A viewport also has a Z-order, i.e. if there is more than one
        viewport on a single render target and they overlap, one must
        obscure the other in some predetermined way.
