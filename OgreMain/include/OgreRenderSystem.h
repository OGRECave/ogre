    /** Defines the functionality of a 3D API

    The RenderSystem class provides a base interface
    which abstracts the general functionality of the 3D API
    e.g. Direct3D or OpenGL. Whilst a few of the general
    methods have implementations, most of this class is
    abstract, requiring a subclass based on a specific API
    to be constructed to provide the full functionality.
    Note there are 2 levels to the interface - one which
    will be used often by the caller of the Ogre library,
    and one which is at a lower level and will be used by the
    other classes provided by Ogre. These lower level
    methods are prefixed with '_' to differentiate them.
    The advanced user of the library may use these lower
    level methods to access the 3D API at a more fundamental
    level (dealing direct with render states and rendering
    primitives), but still benefiting from Ogre's abstraction
    of exactly which 3D API is in use.
