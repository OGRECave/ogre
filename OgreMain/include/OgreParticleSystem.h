        Particle systems are special effects generators which are based on a 
        number of moving points to create the impression of things like like 
        sparkles, smoke, blood spurts, dust etc.
    @par
        This class simply manages a single collection of particles in world space
        with a shared local origin for emission. The visual aspect of the 
        particles is handled by a ParticleSystemRenderer instance.
    @par
        Particle systems are created using the SceneManager, never directly.
        In addition, like all subclasses of MovableObject, the ParticleSystem 
        will only be considered for rendering once it has been attached to a 
        SceneNode.
