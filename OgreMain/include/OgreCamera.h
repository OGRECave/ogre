    /** A viewpoint from which the scene will be rendered.

        OGRE renders scenes from a camera viewpoint into a buffer of
        some sort, normally a window or a texture (a subclass of
        RenderTarget). OGRE cameras support both perspective projection (the default,
        meaning objects get smaller the further away they are) and
        orthographic projection (blueprint-style, no decrease in size
        with distance). Each camera carries with it a style of rendering,
        e.g. full textured, flat shaded, wireframe), field of view,
        rendering distances etc, allowing you to use OGRE to create
        complex multi-window views if required. In addition, more than
        one camera can point at a single render target if required,
        each rendering to a subset of the target, allowing split screen
        and picture-in-picture views.

        At render time, all Scene Objects will be transformed in the camera space,
        which is defined as:
        - \f$+x\f$ is right
        - \f$+y\f$ is up
        - \f$-z\f$ is away

        Cameras maintain their own aspect ratios, field of view, and frustum,
        and project coordinates into normalised device coordinates measured from -1 to 1 in x and y,
        and 0 to 1 in z, where
        - \f$+x\f$ is right
        - \f$+y\f$ is up
        - \f$+z\f$ is away

        At render time, the camera will be rendering to a
        Viewport which will translate these parametric coordinates into real screen
        coordinates. Obviously it is advisable that the viewport has the same
        aspect ratio as the camera to avoid distortion (unless you want it!).
