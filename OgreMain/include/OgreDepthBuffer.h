    /** An abstract class that contains a depth/stencil buffer.
        Depth Buffers can be attached to render targets. Note we handle Depth & Stencil together.
        DepthBuffer sharing is handled automatically for you. However, there are times where you want
        to specifically control depth buffers to achieve certain effects or increase performance.
        You can control this by hinting Ogre with POOL IDs. Created depth buffers can live in different
        pools, or all together in the same one.
        Usually, a depth buffer can only be attached to a RenderTarget if it's dimensions are bigger
        and have the same bit depth and same multisample settings. Depth Buffers are created automatically
        for new RTs when needed, and stored in the pool where the RenderTarget should have drawn from.
        By default, all RTs have the Id POOL_DEFAULT, which means all depth buffers are stored by default
        in that pool. By choosing a different Pool Id for a specific RenderTarget, that RT will only
        retrieve depth buffers from _that_ pool, therefore not conflicting with sharing depth buffers
        with other RTs (such as shadows maps).
        Setting an RT to POOL_MANUAL_USAGE means Ogre won't manage the DepthBuffer for you (not recommended)
        RTs with POOL_NO_DEPTH are very useful when you don't want to create a DepthBuffer for it. You can
        still manually attach a depth buffer though as internally POOL_NO_DEPTH & POOL_MANUAL_USAGE are
        handled in the same way.

        Behavior is consistent across all render systems, if, and only if, the same RSC flags are set
        RSC flags that affect this class are:
        - #RSC_RTT_MAIN_DEPTHBUFFER_ATTACHABLE:
        some APIs (ie. OpenGL w/ FBO) don't allow using
        the main depth buffer for offscreen RTTs. When this flag is set, the depth buffer can be
        shared between the main window and an RTT.
        - #RSC_RTT_INDEPENDENT_BUFFER_SIZE:
        When this flag isn't set, the depth buffer can only be shared across RTTs who have the EXACT
        same resolution. When it's set, it can be shared with RTTs as long as they have a
        resolution less or equal than the depth buffer's.
