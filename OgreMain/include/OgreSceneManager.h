            Whilst ordinarily lights are sorted per rendered object
            (@ref MovableObject::queryLights), texture shadows adds another issue
            in that, given there is a finite number of shadow textures, we must
            choose which lights to render texture shadows from based on the entire
            frustum. These lights should always be listed first in every objects

            shadows (either because they have shadow casting off, or there aren't
            enough shadow textures to service them).

            This hook allows you to override the detailed ordering of the lights
            per frustum. The default ordering is shadow casters first (which you
            must also respect if you override this method), and ordered
            by distance from the camera within those 2 groups. Obviously the closest
            lights with shadow casting enabled will be listed first. Only lights
            within the range of the frustum will be in the list.

            may sort.

    /** Manages the organisation and rendering of a 'scene': a collection of objects and potentially world geometry.

        This class defines the interface and the basic behaviour of a 
        'Scene Manager'. A SceneManager organises the culling and rendering of
        the scene, in conjunction with the RenderQueue. This class is designed 
        to be extended through subclassing in order to provide more specialised
        scene organisation structures for particular needs. The default 
        SceneManager culls based on a hierarchy of node bounding boxes, other
        implementations can use an octree (see OctreeSceneManager), a BSP
        tree (see BspSceneManager), and many other options. New SceneManager
        implementations can be added at runtime by plugins, see 
        SceneManagerEnumerator for the interfaces for adding new SceneManager
        types.

        There is a distinction between 'objects' (which subclass MovableObject, 
        and are movable, discrete objects in the world), and 'world geometry',
        which is large, generally static geometry. World geometry tends to 
        influence the SceneManager organisational structure (e.g. lots of indoor
        static geometry might result in a spatial tree structure) and as such
        world geometry is generally tied to a given SceneManager implementation,
        whilst MovableObject instances can be used with any SceneManager.
        Subclasses are free to define world geometry however they please.

        Multiple SceneManager instances can exist at one time, each one with 
        a distinct scene. Which SceneManager is used to render a scene is
        dependent on the Camera, which will always call back the SceneManager
        which created it to render the scene.

            If you are updating the scene in a separate thread from the rendering
            thread, then you should lock this mutex before making any changes to 
            the scene graph - that means creating, modifying or deleting a
            scene node, or attaching / detaching objects. It is <b>your</b> 
            responsibility to take out this lock, the detail methods on the nodes
            will not do it for you (for the reasons discussed below).
        @par
            Note that locking this mutex will prevent the scene being rendered until 
            it is unlocked again. Therefore you should do this sparingly. Try
            to create any objects you need separately and fully prepare them
            before doing all your scene graph work in one go, thus keeping this
            lock for the shortest time possible.
        @note
            A single global lock is used rather than a per-node lock since 
            it keeps the number of locks required during rendering down to a 
            minimum. Obtaining a lock, even if there is no contention, is not free
            so for performance it is good to do it as little as possible. 
            Since modifying the scene in a separate thread is a fairly
            rare occurrence (relative to rendering), it is better to keep the 
            locking required during rendering lower than to make update locks
            more granular.

                characteristics of your scene

                tiling How many times to tile the texture across the sky.
                Applies to all texture layers. If you need finer control use
                the TextureUnitState texture coordinate transformation methods.
            @param
                drawFirst If true, the plane is drawn before all other
                geometry in the scene, without updating the depth buffer.
                This is the safest rendering method since all other objects
                will always appear in front of the sky. However this is not
                the most efficient way if most of the sky is often occluded
                by other objects. If this is the case, you can set this
                parameter to false meaning it draws <em>after</em> all other
                geometry which can be an optimisation - however you must
                ensure that the plane.d value is large enough that no objects
                will 'poke through' the sky plane when it is rendered.
            @param
                bow If zero, the plane will be completely flat (like previous
                versions.  If above zero, the plane will be curved, allowing
                the sky to appear below camera level.  Curved sky planes are 
                simular to skydomes, but are more compatible with fog.

                Determines the number of segments the plane will have to it. This
                is most important when you are bowing the plane, but may also be useful
                if you need tessellation on the plane to perform per-vertex effects.

            There are multiple ways to generate shadows in a scene, and each has 
            strengths and weaknesses. 
            <ul><li>Stencil-based approaches can be used to 
            draw very long, extreme shadows without loss of precision and the 'additive'
            version can correctly show the shadowing of complex effects like bump mapping
            because they physically exclude the light from those areas. However, the edges
            are very sharp and stencils cannot handle transparency, and they involve a 
            fair amount of CPU work in order to calculate the shadow volumes, especially
            when animated objects are involved.</li>
            <li>Texture-based approaches are good for handling transparency (they can, for
            example, correctly shadow a mesh which uses alpha to represent holes), and they
            require little CPU overhead, and can happily shadow geometry which is deformed
            by a vertex program, unlike stencil shadows. However, they have a fixed precision 
            which can introduce 'jaggies' at long range and have fillrate issues of their own.</li>
            </ul>
        @par
            We support 2 kinds of stencil shadows, and 2 kinds of texture-based shadows, and one
            simple decal approach. The 2 stencil approaches differ in the amount of multipass work 
            that is required - the modulative approach simply 'darkens' areas in shadow after the 
            main render, which is the least expensive, whilst the additive approach has to perform 
            a render per light and adds the cumulative effect, which is more expensive but more 
            accurate. The texture based shadows both work in roughly the same way, the only difference is
            that the shadowmap approach is slightly more accurate, but requires a more recent
            graphics card.
        @par

        /** Sets whether we should use an infinite camera far plane
            when rendering stencil shadows.

            Stencil shadow coherency is very reliant on the shadow volume
            not being clipped by the far plane. If this clipping happens, you
            get a kind of 'negative' shadow effect. The best way to achieve
            coherency is to move the far plane of the camera out to infinity,
            thus preventing the far plane from clipping the shadow volumes.
            When combined with vertex program extrusion of the volume to
            infinity, which Ogre does when available, this results in very
            robust shadow volumes. For this reason, when you enable stencil
            shadows, Ogre automatically changes your camera settings to
            project to infinity if the card supports it. You can disable this
            behaviour if you like by calling this method; although you can
            never enable infinite projection if the card does not support it.
        @par
            If you disable infinite projection, or it is not available,
            you need to be far more careful with your light attenuation /
            directional light extrusion distances to avoid clipping artefacts
            at the far plane.
        @note
            Recent cards will generally support infinite far plane projection.
            However, we have found some cases where they do not, especially
            on Direct3D. There is no standard capability we can check to
            validate this, so we use some heuristics based on experience:
            <UL>
            <LI>OpenGL always seems to support it no matter what the card</LI>
            <LI>Direct3D on non-vertex program capable systems (including
            vertex program capable cards on Direct3D7) does not
            support it</LI>
            <LI>Direct3D on GeForce3 and GeForce4 Ti does not seem to support
            infinite projection</LI>
            </UL>
            Therefore in the RenderSystem implementation, we may veto the use
            of an infinite far plane based on these heuristics.
