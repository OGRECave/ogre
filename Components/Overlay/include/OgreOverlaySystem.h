        OGRE root did this steps before the overlay system transformed into a component.

        Before you create a concrete instance of the OverlaySystem the OGRE::Root must be created
        but not initialized. In the ctor all relevant systems are created and registered. The dtor
        must be called before you delete OGRE::Root.
        To make the overlays visible (= render into your viewports) you have to register this
        instance as a RenderQueueListener in your scenemanager(s).
