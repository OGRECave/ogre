    /** Represents a layer which is rendered on top of the 'normal' scene contents.

        An overlay is a container for visual components (2D and 3D) which will be 
        rendered after the main scene in order to composite heads-up-displays, menus
        or other layers on top of the contents of the scene.
    @par
        An overlay always takes up the entire size of the viewport, although the 
        components attached to it do not have to. An overlay has no visual element
        in itself, it it merely a container for visual elements.
    @par
        Overlays are created by calling OverlayManager::create, or by defining them
        in special text scripts (.overlay files). As many overlays
        as you like can be defined; after creation an overlay is hidden i.e. not
        visible until you specifically enable it by calling 'show'. This allows you to have multiple
        overlays predefined (menus etc) which you make visible only when you want.
        It is possible to have multiple overlays enabled at once; in this case the
        relative 'zorder' parameter of the overlays determine which one is displayed
        on top.
    @par
        By default overlays are rendered into all viewports. This is fine when you only
        have fullscreen viewports, but if you have picture-in-picture views, you probably
        don't want the overlay displayed in the smaller viewports. You turn this off for 
        a specific viewport by calling the Viewport::setDisplayOverlays method.

        /** Adds a node capable of holding 3D objects to the overlay.

            Although overlays are traditionally associated with 2D elements, there 
            are reasons why you might want to attach 3D elements to the overlay too.
            For example, if you wanted to have a 3D cockpit, which was overlaid with a
            HUD, then you would create 2 overlays, one with a 3D object attached for the
            cockpit, and one with the HUD elements attached (the zorder of the HUD 
            overlay would be higher than the cockpit to ensure it was always on top).

            A SceneNode can have any number of 3D objects attached to it. SceneNodes
            are usually created using SceneManager::createSceneNode, but in this case
            you should create a standard SceneNode instance <b>manually</b>; this is
            because these scene nodes are not managed by the SceneManager and some custom
            SceneManager plugins will rely on specialist behaviour the overlay does not
            support. By attaching a SceneNode to an overlay, you indicate that:<OL>
            <LI>You want the contents of this node to only appear when the overlay is active</LI>
            <LI>You want the node to inherit a coordinate space relative to the camera,
                rather than relative to the root scene node</LI>
            <LI>You want these objects to be rendered after the contents of the main scene
                to ensure they are rendered on top</LI>
            </OL>
            One major consideration when using 3D objects in overlays is the behaviour of 
            the depth buffer. Overlays should use materials with depth checking off, to ensure
            that their contents are always displayed on top of the main scene (to do 
            otherwise would result in objects 'poking through' the overlay). The problem
            with using 3D objects is that if they are concave, or self-overlap, then you
            can get artefacts because of the lack of depth buffer checking. So you should 
            ensure that any 3D objects you us in the overlay are convex, and don't overlap
            each other. If they must overlap, split them up and put them in 2 overlays.
            Alternatively, use a 2D element underneath them which will clear the depth buffer
            values underneath ready for the 3D element to be rendered correctly.
