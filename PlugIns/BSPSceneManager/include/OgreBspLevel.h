        automatically arrange the loading of the level. Note that this assumes

        ST_INDOOR when calling Root::getSceneManager).
        Ogre currently only supports loading from Quake3 Arena level files,
        although any source that can be converted into this classes structure
        could also be used. The Quake3 level load process is in a different
        class called Quake3Level to keep the specifics separate.

            Leaf nodes are assigned to 'clusters' of nodes, which are used to group nodes together for
            visibility testing. This data holds a lookup table which is used to determine if one cluster of leaves
            is visible from another cluster. Whilst it would be possible to expand all this out so that
            each node had a list of pointers to other visible nodes, this would be very expensive in terms
            of storage (using the cluster method there is a table which is 1-bit squared per cluster, rounded
            up to the nearest byte obviously, which uses far less space than 4-bytes per linked node per source
            node). Of course the limitation here is that you have to each leaf in turn to determine if it is visible
            rather than just following a list, but since this is only done once per frame this is not such a big
            overhead.
            Each row in the table is a 'from' cluster, with each bit in the row corresponding to a 'to' cluster,
            both ordered based on cluster index. A 0 in the bit indicates the 'to' cluster is not visible from the
            'from' cluster, whilst a 1 indicates it is.
            As many will notice, this is lifted directly from the Quake implementation of PVS.
