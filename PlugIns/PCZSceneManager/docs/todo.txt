This file contains a list of todo items for the PCZSceneManager plugin.
Some items are specific, some are not, it's just a list to keep notes for myself.

UPDATES:
-------------
* PCZFrustum treats infinite bounds as always visible and zero bounds as always invisible (Thanks Fish). 11/11/08
* PCZoneFactory eats a const String &, so code has been updated to use PCZoneFactory("ZoneType_Default")
  instead of PCZoneFactory (String("ZoneType_Default")).  (10/17/08)
* PCZSM now zeroes out the SkyBoxObj, SkyPlane, and SkyDome pointers when clearScene() is called. (10/26/08)
* if a scene node is anchored to a zone, then child scene nodes created from that
  scene node (via SceneNode::createChildSceneNode()) are also anchored to the same zone. (5/8/08)
* Portals can now be closed & opened (see Portal::close() and Portal::open()).
  Closing a portal prevents scene traversal through the portal and also prevents
  scene nodes from crossing the portal. (4/24/08)
* Infinite Recursion bug for scene traversal FIXED.  This was fixed by adding an
  additional culling plane drawn from the actual plane of quad portals.  The infinite recursion
  bug occurred in situations where a viewer was outside a building, could look straight through
  the building back to the outside, and then into another building similarly set up.  This
  situation is still VERY bad from a performance standpoint, but at least it doesn't crash.  (4/24/08)
* The PCZFrustum now uses a Culling Plane Reservoir which eliminates the constant memory
  allocations/de-allocations for PCPlanes during the culling process. (03/18/08)
* Light zones now only update affected list when portals move or lights move (Thanks Aulcard)
  (03/25/08)
* PCZSceneNodes now only save old spatial data when they move (Thanks Aulcard) (03/25/08)

KNOWN BUGS:
-------------
* Light traversal is not quite correct.  In order to avoid infinite recursion, I had to
  put in a hack which can potentially result in light not traversing into some zones properly.
  It will probably not be noticeable in most situations, but could potentially show up in
  very complex portal/zone setups.

TODO:
-------------
* Allow portals to connect to the same zone they are in
* Test function to prevent scenenodes from crossing portals which they won't fit through
* More testing 


OPTIMIZATIONS (todo):
---------------------
* All Portals calculate position update every frame, similar to how PCZSceneNodes were updating
  every frame.  This could be changed so that it is only done when portals move/changes.
* OctreeZone - utilize octree when determining portal visibility (currently does 
  separate check not accelerated by octree) for both cameras and light frustums).
* Add scissor rects for portals which are fully visible (i.e. all 4 sides)
* TerrainZoneRenderable has a function for intersecting segments.  Maybe (?) able to
  use my Ogre::Segment class instead of Ray?

FUTURE FEATURES:
----------------
* Add anti-portals?
