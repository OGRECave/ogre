<h1>OGRE Meshes Exporter</h1>
<p>
Blender is an open source 3D content creation suite for modeling, animation, rendering and video post production. The OGRE Meshes Exporter is a set of python scripts to run directly within Blender. Currently it supports the export of
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  mesh objects with vertex colours, multiple materials, uv textures and blend modes,
  </li>
  <li>
  armature keyframe animations,
  </li>
  <li>
  relative mesh shape animations.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The script needs access to standard Python modules not shipped with Blender. Consult the Blender documentation at <a href="http://www.blender.org"> www.blender.org</a> how to incorporate Python with Blender.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Copy the the script and all subdirectories either into ".blender/scripts" or the user defined scripts directory.
  </li>
  <li>
  In the "Scripts Window" run "Scripts &rarr; Update Menus".
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Basic Usage">Basic Usage</a></h2>
<p>
  There is a one-to-one correspondence:
</p>
<div class="importantBox">
  <div class="center">
    Blender Object (OB) &harr; Ogre::SceneNode
  </div>
  <div class="center">
    Blender Mesh (ME) &harr; Ogre::Entity
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  The OGRE Meshes Exporter maps Blender Meshes (ME) to Ogre Entities. Please refer to the OGRE Scene Exporter for the mapping of Blender Objects (OB) to Ogre SceneNodes.
</p>
<p>
To export Blender Meshes (ME) do:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  In the "3D View" select the mesh objects you want to export.
  </li>
  <li>
  In the "Scripts Window" run "Scripts &rarr; Export &rarr; OGRE Meshes".
  </li>
  <li>
  Choose your export options.
  </li>
  <li>
  Press the "Export" button.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
You will get a detailed log of the export process. All files are exported in the OGRE XML format. Use the
OgreXMLConverter of your OGRE installation to convert the generated XML files to binary .mesh and .skeleton files.

<p>The script loads and saves its options to a text buffer
"OgrePackage.cfg" inside the current .blend file. You can save the current settings, if you save the .blend file after quitting the exporter.
</p>

<h2><a name="Meshes">Meshes</a></h2>

<p>The script supports sticky and per face vertex uv coordinates,
smoothed and non-smoothed normals, vertex colours. Each rectangle face
is automatically converted into two triangle faces in the exported mesh. The exporter defaults to using 16 bit indices but if the submesh vertex count exceeds the 16 bit limit then 32 bit indices are used.</p>

<p>The script does not support subdivision surface (SubSurf) options.
To export a SubSurf object, you have to convert it into a Mesh object,
"Object &rarr; Convert Object Type... &rarr; Mesh (keep original)".</p>

<p>The script does not support the "Double Sided" mesh option, use the "Two Sided" face option instead.</p>

<p>To force the export of vertex colours, select "VCol Light" in the meshes' materials and export with "Game Engine Materials" disabled.
</p>

<h2><a name="Materials">Materials</a></h2>

<p>In contrast to OGRE, Blender treats material, uv texture and blend
mode separately. Also Blender distinguishes between material appearance
in the game engine and material appearance in the rendered results.
</p>

<h3><a name="Rendering Materials">Rendering Materials</a></h3>

<p>The name of the exported material is the same as in Blender. If the
"Two Sided" face option is set, the suffix "/TWOSIDE" is appended. If
the "TexFace" material option is set, the suffix "/TEXFACE" and the
name of the texture image that is assigned with the UV/Image Editor is
appended. The "Two Sided" face option has no effect in Blender's
rendering results and is evaluated on export for convenience only.

<h3><a name="Game Engine Materials">Game Engine Materials</a></h3>
The material name has to be unique. Therefore, the name of the exported
material consists of Blender's material name (if any), the face blend
mode and texture file name (if any). If vertex colours are defined, a
postfix "/VertCol" is appended. Also, if the two-sided face option is
set, "/TWOSIDE" is appended.

<p>If a material is assigned to face, only the properties that affect
the appearance in the game engine are exported. These are the "Col" and
"Spe" colours, the "Amb", "Spec" and "Hard" factors and the "VCol
Paint" and "TexFace" options.
</p>
Textures assigned with the UV/Image Editor are exported. Note that
material image textures, which can be exported as rendering engine
materials, give you more control over filtering and texture address
modes.

Blender's face settings affect the mesh appearance only in the game
engine. The properties exported by the script are marked green.

<h3><a name="Armature Animations">Armature Animations</a></h3>

<p>Armature animation export is available if the mesh has an armature as parent deform or an armature modifier and that armature has at least one action. Armature animations are exported based upon keyframe ranges and action names. You can choose any frame as start and end frame of an animation. In order to export armature animations of a mesh you don't have to select the armature
separately. On export, the script will sample the bone poses of the selected action frame by frame.
</p>
<ul>
<li>All vertices must be assigned to at least one bone.</li>
<li>In OGRE, you can have no more than four weighted bone assignments per mesh
vertex.</li>
<li>Note that OGRE does not inherit parent bone scaling by default.</li>
</ul>

The script supports a parented armature as well as an armature modifier.

<h3><a name="Shape Animations">Shape Animations</a></h3>
Relative shape animations can be exported as pose or morph animations. On export, the script will sample the vertex positions frame by frame.
